# T_9-Texting-Replica
A java implementation of the old T_9 texting style for old flip phones.

Given a keypad, where the number 2 stands for the letters a or b or c, and
the number 3 stands for the letters d or e or f, etc, as defined on the
keypad of an old cellphone

A user can input a sequence of numbers and the algorithm will output all of
the valid english words represented by the input sequence of numbers.

This program implements the dictionary in two seperate ways, using a HashTable
and using a PrefixTree. The speed of each implementation is recorded to find out
which implementation is the faster of the two.
